        <p class="lead">Master of Science in Engineering, PhD</p>
        <p>Date of birth: September 2, 1986</p>
        <p>
            Experienced software engineer and data scientist. Strong theoretical foundation with a solid understanding of business. I excel at bringing visions to life - both at a strategic and implementation level.
        </p>
        <p>
            I strongly believe in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning as game changers for data-driven companies, but also acknowledge that model-building is only a small part of this. It is paramount to understand the business needs, the domain and the expected value creation in order to understand 1) what kind of model is needed and 2) how well this model needs to perform. Why go for a 99,999% accurate model, if 95% does the trick? I have a pragmatic approach to problem solving and I want to deliver value, not just a theoretical performance increase.

            I live in Allerød north of Copenhagen with my wife, Eva and our daughters, Rebekka og Leonora.

## Work Experience

#### Microsoft
`2021-now`
**Principal Data and Applied Scientist Manager**
> Working in M365 Core as part of Microsoft Development Center Norway. We empower people and organizations to achieve more by building AI powered, intelligent productivity tools. The group I am working in focuses on people, what they do and who they collaborate with. 
> 
> I lead a team of 10 people, both data scientists and software engineers, that build models that help people collaborate more effectively. Our services are part of the M365 suite (Outlook, Word, Excel, etc) which is used by millions of people every day.

#### Zibra Group

`2020-2021`
**ZibraLabs: ML Engineer (R&D)**
> ZibraLabs was created to allow creative minds with skills in software, AI, 3d printing, mechanics and hardware to build and experiment with ideas that should hopefully lead to business opportunities. In ZibraLabs I had multiple responsibilities:
> - Team lead for our AI initiative. Responsible for our AI vision. We experiment with various ideas and projects, like a chatbot for matching problems in larger organizations with competences in employees. We try as much as possible to "fail fast" by building prototypes that can show the potential of an idea in its entirety (e.g. from user input to actual recommendation), rather than just verifying parts of an idea (e.g. the model itself).
> - Algorithms for NIVO Performance: Building efficient algorithms in Numpy for analyzing full horse training sessions. Using machine learning for gait classification and dressage exercise classification within the algorithms.
> - Backend for NIVO Performance along with some frontend and Android app development. 

`2019—2020`
**NIVO Performance: Lead Software Architect**
> NIVO Performance develops sensors and platform for horses and riders to predict and prevent injuries and to track and analyze training sessions.
> My main responsibilities include using Machine Learning and AI to make sense of the collected sensor data, building algorithms for running on hardware and building the NIVO  backend.

#### LINK Mobility

`2017—2019`
**Lead Data Scientist and Head of LINK Intelligence Technology**
> As lead data scientist in LINK Mobility, I was responsible for all things technology, analytics, statistics and AI in LINK Mobility Group. All of this is consolidated in the Mobile Intelligence area, where I worked closely together with my commercial counterpart. 
>
> My work included:
> - Consolidation of business data in data lake
> - Statistical analyses
> - AI and Machine learning
> - Automated reporting tools (both internal and external)
> - Next-generation AI possibilities
>
> I have built prediction algorithms for targeting the right end users with mobile offers (i.e. predict the probability of conversion). I work with unsupervised learning and cognitive computing for unstructured text to offer solutions that use the contents of SMS messages to improve results.

`2016—2017`
**Director of Technology (CTO), LINK Mobility Denmark**
> In 2016, Responsfabrikken was acquired by LINK Mobility Group. I continued in my role as CTO until 2017.

#### Responsfabrikken    

`2015—2016`
**CTO**
> After completing my PhD, I returned as CTO. I was responsible for a team of 6 developers (backend and frontend). I worked closely together with our sales team and project management team. 

`2010—2012`
**Systems Developer**
> After graduating, I was part of the team that designed and implemented our first SMS flow-builder, and was responsible for improving and maintaining our SMS gateway. 

`2009—2010`
**Java Developer**
> I started at Responsfabrikken as a student developer, working part-time.
